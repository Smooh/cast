# Smooh Cast
Smooh Cast is a free online screen recording tool, capable of showing your camera along with the recording as picture-in-picture (pip) on browsers that support it.

If the browser supports PWA, it is also possible to install Smooh Cast and use it offline.

The tool can be accessed [here](https://smooh.tech/cast/).
